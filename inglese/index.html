            <h2>What is a Linux "Distribution" (Distro)?</h2>
            <p>Technically, <strong>Linux</strong> refers only to the "kernel," the core component that manages the computer's hardware (memory, CPU, devices). On its own, the kernel is unusable for a typical user.</p>
            <p>A <strong>Linux Distribution (Distro)</strong> is a complete operating system that packages the Linux kernel together with many other essential components to make it usable. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>System Utilities</strong> (often from the GNU project).</li>
                <li><strong>A Desktop Environment</strong> (the graphical interface with windows and menus).</li>
                <li><strong>A Package Manager</strong> (a system for easily installing, updating, and removing software).</li>
                <li><strong>Pre-installed Applications</strong> (browser, text editor, media player).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In short: if the Linux kernel is the engine, the "distro" is the entire car (engine, chassis, wheels, interior) ready to be driven.</p>

            <h2>Famous Distributions and Their Purposes</h2>

            <div class="distro-card">
                <h3>1. Debian</h3>
                <h4>Purpose:</h4>
                <p>Created to be the universal and free operating system. It focuses on maximum stability and adherence to free software principles.</p>
                <h4>Characteristics:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is the "mother" of many other distros (including Ubuntu).</li>
                    <li>Its software is not always the very latest version available, but it is thoroughly tested to ensure system stability.</li>
                    <li>Widely used on servers.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="distro-card">
                <h3>2. Ubuntu</h3>
                <h4>Purpose:</h4>
                <p>Created to make Linux accessible to humans ("Linux for human beings"). The goal is to bring the power of Debian into an easy-to-install and easy-to-use format for the average user.</p>
                <h4>Characteristics:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Probably the most famous distro in the world.</li>
                    <li>Has commercial backing (the Canonical company) and a huge community.</li>
                    <li>Excellent for both desktop and cloud environments.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="distro-card">
                <h3>3. Fedora</h3>
                <h4>Purpose:</h4>
                <p>To be at the forefront of innovation. It serves as a testing ground for new technologies that will eventually make their way into *Red Hat Enterprise Linux* (a widely used commercial enterprise version).</p>
                <h4>Characteristics:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Always offers the latest versions of software and the kernel.</li>
                    <li>Ideal for developers and enthusiasts who want to see the future of Linux ahead of others.</li>
                </ul>

        <section id="recommendation">
            <h2>Recommendation for Beginners</h2>
            <p>If I had to recommend a distribution to an absolute beginner (especially someone coming from Windows), I would choose <strong>Linux Mint</strong>.</p>
            <h4>Why Linux Mint?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Familiar Interface:</strong> Linux Mint often uses a desktop environment (like "Cinnamon") that closely resembles Windows 7 or 10. It has a bottom taskbar, a "Start" menu on the left, and system icons where you'd expect them. There's no need to relearn how to use the computer.</li>
                <li><strong>All-Inclusive:</strong> Unlike some more purist distros, Mint natively includes multimedia codecs needed for watching movies or listening to music, and proprietary drivers (like those for Wi-Fi or video cards) right from installation. It works "out of the box."</li>
                <li><strong>Stability:</strong> Being based on Ubuntu (which in turn is based on Debian), it inherits a solid foundation and access to a massive amount of software and online guides.</li>
            </ul>
